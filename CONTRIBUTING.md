# Guide to Contributing

## Project Values, Team Norms, Definition of "Done"

- Kindness, Consideration, and Understanding between team members

- Assigned work is expected to be completed in a timely manner

- If help is needed it should be asked for and team members should assist one another to the best of their ability

- "Done" is defined as when the User is able to successfully share their clipboard across multiple devices through an easy to understand UI

## Rules of Contribution

- All materials of the current sprint should be contributed to the project

## Conflict Resolution

- Disagreements and conflicts will be resolved through a panel discussion between all developers. We'll go over pros and cons behind suggestions, disagreements, and conflicts and seek to come to the best conclusion by voting on which direction the team wants to go.

## Instructions for setting up the local development environment in order to view/work on this project

This project uses [Expo](https://expo.io/), an open-source platform for developing React Native applications for iOS, Android, and Web. Here's how you can get setup:

1.  Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2.  Clone this repository to your local machine
3.  Open a terminal in the repository, and run the following commands to install required dependencies and setup the Expo build server:

        cd front-end
        npm install
        npm start

4.  The final command will start an Expo server on your local machine and open Metro Bundler in your default web browser. You can run the app in your web browser directly from there, but to run on a mobile device, you will need to install Expo Go (available on the App Store and the Play Store). Once installed, on iPhone, use the default camera to scan the QR code in metro bundler, which will automatically build the app in Expo Go. On Android, you can scan the QR code from inside the Expo Go app.
5.  If you wish to run the app in a simulator, you can follow the following guides to run on an emulated [iPhone](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/ios-simulator/) (note that this requires a Mac), and to run on an emulated [Android Device](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) (works on all operating systems).
